### Ahoy-hoy, fellow digital adventurers and code monkeys! I'm Aradhye Swarup.

Welcome to my little corner of the internet, where I turn coffee into code and chaotic ideas into (mostly) functional applications. I'm a full-stack developer and AI engineer by trade, which is a fancy way of saying I build cool stuff that people can actually use.

I once founded a creative tech startup called **nahneed.** that clawed its way to the finals of a university startup competition. We had 50+ users, which is basically a billion in startup-land.

### My Digital Toolbox ðŸ§°

I've dabbled in a bit of everything. Here's the arsenal I bring to the keyboard battlefield:

*   **Languages:** C, C++, Python, Java, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, noSQL (Basically, if you can write "Hello World" in it, I've probably used it).
*   **Frameworks & Tools:** React.js, Next.js, TailwindCSS, Node.js, Django, FastAPI, Express.js, MongoDB.
*   **The Serious Stuff (DevOps):** Git, AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, Azure Cloud.
*   **My Robot Brain (ML):** Numpy, Pandas, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, R, MATLAB.

### Behold! My Creations! ðŸš€

Here are some of the glorious projects I've Frankensteined into existence:

*   **Echoid:** A voice synthesis platform that gives AI emotions. Because who wants a robot that sounds like a bored GPS? It's all done on-premise, saving a boatload on API costs.
*   **Fortify:** A Solidity IDE with built-in ML vulnerability detection. It compiles contracts faster than you can say "blockchain revolution" (under 500ms, to be exact).
*   **EvoPacts:** Smart contracts for athlete-club agreements. It's like Moneyball, but with more cryptography and less Brad Pitt.

### A Tale of Two Resumes ðŸ“œ

You've come seeking my life story on a single sheet of paper. A noble quest!

*   Behold, `AradhyeSwarupResume.pdf`! This is my old, battle-worn resume from my 3rd year. A relic of a bygone era.
*   But wait! The shiny, new, upgraded model is `resume.pdf`. This is my 4th-year masterpiece, forged in the fires of final-year projects and sleep deprivation.

Choose the new one. Seriously.

### The Placement Gauntlet ðŸ“Š

If you're a glutton for punishment and want to see the raw, unfiltered chaos of the job hunt, check out `placement_stats.numbers`. It's a tracker of my journey through the wonderful world of college placements. Spoilers: it's a rollercoaster.
